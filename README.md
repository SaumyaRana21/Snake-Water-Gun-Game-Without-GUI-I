# Snake-Water-Gun-Game-Without-GUI-I
Snake Water Gun game using python using random module. 
As this game is not a multiplayer game and is played with the computer so random module is used. When you mention "Snake Water Gun game without GUI," it means that the game does not have a graphical user interface or any visual components. Instead, it relies on the console or command-line interface for interaction.  In a game without a GUI, the player interacts with the game solely through text-based input and output. The player typically enters their choice or command using the keyboard, and the game displays information and results as text in the console.  In the case of the Snake Water Gun game, without a GUI, you would see text prompts asking you to enter your choice (snake, water, or gun), and the game would display the computer's choice and the result of the game (whether the player wins, the computer wins, or it's a tie) in the console. The game would continue running in the console until the player decides to exit or quit the game.  A text-based game without GUI can be simpler to develop and play compared to a graphical game, as it does not require creating graphical assets or handling complex user interface interactions. It focuses more on the gameplay and logic, relying on textual representations and commands for interaction.
